Approach and Challenges
Approach
React with TypeScript Integration:

I started by setting up a basic React app and integrating TypeScript to ensure type safety. TypeScript provided strong typing for components, Redux actions, and state, ensuring that the app was more predictable and reliable.
State Management with Redux Toolkit:

I used Redux Toolkit to simplify the state management for fetching and storing user data. The createAsyncThunk function was used to handle asynchronous API calls, ensuring that data fetching logic remained separate from UI components.
The slice was created to manage the user state, which included storing user data and handling filtering logic. The filtering inputs dispatched actions to update the Redux state.
Dynamic Filtering:

For the filtering functionality, I added individual input fields for each column (name, username, email, phone). Every time the user typed in one of the fields, it triggered a Redux action that updated the state and re-filtered the users. This ensured real-time updates in the table based on the user's input.
Fetching User Data from API:

I used the mock API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users to fetch the user data. The fetched data was stored in the Redux store, and it updated the UI dynamically when users searched for specific fields.
UI Design:

I aimed to keep the design clean and user-friendly. The table layout was designed to ensure that users could easily view and filter the user information without distractions.
Challenges
TypeScript Integration:

One challenge was ensuring proper TypeScript typings throughout the application, especially in Redux. Managing the types for actions, state, and API responses required careful attention to ensure strong type safety without introducing unnecessary complexity.
Filtering Logic:

Ensuring that the filter worked efficiently for multiple columns simultaneously was a challenge. The filtering needed to update in real-time without performance degradation, and keeping the logic clean was essential to avoid re-renders and unnecessary updates.
API Handling and Error Management:

Another challenge was managing potential errors from the mock API and ensuring that the UI responded appropriately. Although the JSONPlaceholder API is generally reliable, handling cases where the data might not load or an error occurs was important for user experience.
Overall, the project focused on creating a seamless, typed, and state-managed user management table with real-time filtering, leveraging both React and Redux Toolkit with TypeScript for a scalable solution.
